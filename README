Ruby Netlink
============

This library provides an API for using a Linux Netlink socket, for doing
things like manipulating IP interfaces, routes and firewall rules
programmatically.

Useful reference material
=========================

* http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7356
* http://people.redhat.com/nhorman/papers/netlink.pdf
* apt-get source iproute

Note there are some errors in the nhorman paper. On page 8/9, it says

    nlmsg_pid ... Also note that it is
    imperative that any program receiving netlink socket messages from
    the kernel verify that this ﬁeld is set to zero, or it is possible to expose
    the software to unexpected inﬂuences from other non-privlidged user
    space programs.

However, what really needs to be checked is the pid in the sockaddr_nl
structure returned by recvmsg msghdr, as shown by this code in
lib/libnetlink.c:

        struct msghdr msg = {
                .msg_name = &nladdr,
                .msg_namelen = sizeof(nladdr),
                .msg_iov = &iov,
                .msg_iovlen = 1,
        };
...
                status = recvmsg(rth->fd, &msg, 0);
...
                                if (nladdr.nl_pid != 0 ||
                                    h->nlmsg_pid != rth->local.nl_pid ||
                                    h->nlmsg_seq != rth->dump) {
